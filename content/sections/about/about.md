Hi, I am Spandana Kalakonda, a computer science student graduating in May 2023 from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville with master’s degree.  I’m passionate about creating quality products and learning new techniques and technologies. I am currently working as a teaching assistant for computer science department where I will be grading homework’s and giving feedback about their work. At my last job I worked as a clerk at Union Station convenience store on campus. Where I gained lot of interpersonal skills and had implemented strategic planning to increase the sales.
